## Anomaly-1: 

This quadrant of the image reveals a distinct triangular shape, standing out as white or blank against the densely packed background of celestial objects (galaxies and stars). It is more clearly defined in the deconstructed layers.

The triangle spans half of the image vertically, tapering from a wider top to a sharper bottom, forming an inverted isosceles triangle. This empty space likely represents either:

- A data dropout or gap in the astronomical imaging process.
- A masked or occluded sensor area in the telescope.
